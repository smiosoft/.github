# Code of Conduct

## Introduction

This Code of Conduct outlines our expectations for participants within the Smiosoft community, as well as steps for reporting unacceptable behavior. We are committed to providing a welcoming and inclusive community for all and expect this code of conduct to be honored by everyone who participates. Violations of this code may result in being banned from the community.

Our community aspires to:

- **Be Welcoming, Friendly, and Patient**: We embrace beginners and experts, from all backgrounds. Everyone was new at some point, and we remember that feeling.
- **Be Considerate**: Remember that decisions you make will affect others, and those consequences should be taken into account.
- **Be Respectful**: Disagreement is natural, but should not be an excuse for poor behavior or personal attacks. 
- **Be Collaborative**: Our strength comes from combining our skills. Collaboration greatly improves the quality of our community.

### Diversity and Inclusion Statement

Smiosoft values diversity and is committed to building an inclusive community where everyone feels they belong. We believe a diverse community benefits everyone involved. Although we may not always meet everyone's needs, we respect everyone equally. 

When mistakes are made, we take responsibility and learn from them. Discrimination or harassment based on protected characteristics, including disability, is not tolerated.

## Scope

This Code of Conduct applies within all Smiosoft project spaces, and also when an individual is representing the project or its community in public spaces. Representation of a project may be further defined by project maintainers.

### Reporting Concerns

If you encounter or witness behavior that goes against our Code of Conduct, please report it to us at [nick.smirnoff@smiosoft.com](mailto:nick.smirnoff@smiosoft.com). All reports are confidential and will be reviewed promptly.

Please provide:

- Your contact details.
- Details of those involved.
- A description of the incident and if it's ongoing.
- Any available records or links.
- Any other relevant information.

Anyone asked to stop unacceptable behavior is expected to comply immediately. Actions in response to a violation of this Code of Conduct may range from a warning to a permanent ban, based on the severity of the behavior.
