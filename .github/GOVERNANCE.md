# Smiosoft Project Governance

This document outlines the governance structure of the Smiosoft projects. It describes the decision-making processes, roles, and responsibilities within the project's community.

## Core Principles

- **Transparency**: All project decisions, discussions, and proceedings should be done in the open. This ensures trust and collaboration among contributors.
- **Meritocracy**: Contributions are evaluated based on their merit, considering their quality and impact on the project.
- **Inclusivity**: All contributors, regardless of their background or affiliation, are treated equally. The community is welcoming and supportive.

## Roles and Responsibilities

### 1. Contributors

Contributors are anyone who contributes to the project in any form, be it code, documentation, design, etc.

**Responsibilities**:
- Ensure their contributions align with the project goals and guidelines.
- Collaborate with reviewers and maintainers for merging their changes.

### 2. Reviewers

Reviewers are responsible for reviewing the quality of contributions.

**Responsibilities**:
- Provide constructive feedback on contributions.
- Collaborate with contributors to improve the contribution.
- Ensure contributions align with the project's standards and objectives.

### 3. Maintainers

Maintainers are the guardians of the project. They have the final say in decision-making processes and are responsible for the project's direction, health, and sustainability.

**Responsibilities**:
- Set the strategic direction of the project.
- Make final decisions on controversial or disputed changes.
- Ensure the project's quality and consistency.
- Handle project-level governance tasks.

## Decision Making Process

1. **Consensus Seeking**: For most decisions, the community seeks a consensus. Anyone can make a proposal, which is then discussed by the community.
2. **Voting**: If consensus cannot be reached, a vote is taken. Each maintainer gets one vote, and a simple majority determines the outcome.
3. **Emergency Decisions**: In rare cases of security vulnerabilities or other emergencies, the maintainers can make an immediate decision. They will then seek retroactive approval from the community.

## Conflict Resolution

If there's a dispute within the community:

1. Parties involved will try to find a resolution through discussion.
2. If they can't resolve it, the maintainers will make a final decision.

## Changes to Governance

Proposals to change the project's governance can be made by any community member. These proposals are discussed and can be integrated after reaching a consensus or through a maintainers' vote.
